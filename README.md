# Coffee Sales Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a raw coffee shop sales dataset originally sourced from **Kaggle**. The primary goal is to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in **Google Colab** to uncover actionable business insights. The final output is a dashboard built in **Looker Studio** that visualizes key performance indicators and trends.

## Business Questions
This analysis aims to answer several key business questions:
1.  What is the overall sales performance (Total Revenue & Total Transactions)?
2.  What is the sales trend from month to month?
3.  Which coffee products are the best-sellers and most profitable?
4.  What are the busiest times for the coffee shop (by day of the week and time of day)?
5.  What are the most common payment methods used by customers?

## Analysis Workflow
1.  **Data Sourcing:** The original raw dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** The initial data was processed in a Google Colab notebook. This included handling missing values, correcting data types for date fields, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** New, insightful columns (`month`, `year`, `day_name`, `time_of_day`) were created to facilitate deeper analysis.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Aggregations and initial visualizations were performed within the notebook to identify patterns in sales by day, time, product, etc.
5.  **Dashboard Development:** The key insights from the analysis were then visualized in a dynamic, one-page Looker Studio dashboard for easy business performance tracking.
